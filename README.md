# Grammarbot

A Ruby API client for [GrammrBot API](https://www.grammarbot.io/quickstart)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'grammarbot'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install grammarbot

## Usage
Client initialization, `api_key` and `language` are optional and could be ommited.

    gbot = Grammarbot::Client.new(api_key: 'grammarbot_default_key', language: 'en-US')

Don't want to check the key into source control? Put the key on the GRAMMARBOT_API_KEY environment variable!


Simple example

    result = gbot.check("I can't remember how to go their.")

    result.language.code # => 'en-US'
    result.matches.size # => 1
    result.matches.first.message # => "Statistics suggests that 'there' (as in 'Is there an answer?') might be the correct word here, not 'their' (as in 'Itâ€™s not their fault.'). Please check."
